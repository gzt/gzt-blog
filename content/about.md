I'm Geoff Thompson, a PhD candidate at the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University.
I should be defending this fall (2019). My research interests have been in clustering
and other classification problems as well as unsupervised or semisupervised learning.
But, generally, a lot of aspects of going from large messy real-world data 
to the truth of what is going on. I work on the "Model" part of 
the "Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data" formulation of Data Science.
The applications have mostly been image-related, but I don't care what things 
*look* like, really. I also enjoyed working with the statistical consulting group 
for a couple years, since other people's problems are more interesting than my own, 
as that means I would work on the part that's interesting to me and 
they would work on the part that's interesting to them, then they would get to do the 
hard work of finishing the project and writing. For a moment, you feel like an expert 
in a completely foreign field. 

I also like long walks on the beach.

### Awards

 * 2014 ASA Statistical Computing Section Student Paper Award
 * 2015 ISU Departmental Award for Excellence in Statistical Computing
 * 2017 ISU Departmental Award for Excellence in Statistical Consulting
 
### Projects
 
 * In progress: forensic matching of knife fragments using matrix variate discriminant analysis and some other applications of matrix variate discriminant analysis.
 * `matrixdist` an R package for working with matrix variate distributions such as the matrix variate normal or matrix variate *t*-distribution. On [github](https://www.github.com/gzt/matrixdist).
 * `CholWishart` an R package for some distributions and functions related to the Wishart, in particular sampling from the Cholesky factorization of the Wishart and inverse Wishart. On [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CholWishart) and [github](https://www.github.com/gzt/CholWishart).
 * Porting [scalable *k*-means++](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6402) (or *k*-means||) to OpenMPI (a minor work).
 * A [small C program](https://www.github.com/gzt/replaceR) to replace the use of the Rmath standalone library for random  number generation. 
 * In progress: a [similarity metric](https://www.github.com/gzt/catsim) for binomial and multinomial image comparison accounting for structural similarity, after the model of the MS-SSIM metric.
 * In progress: a parallelization of Hartigan and Wong's k-means algorithm for OpenMPI.
 * In progress: a clustering-based image compression algorithm - see the 2014 award.
 * In progress: multinomial clustering with covariates.

 * In progress: even more.

### Other activities

 * STATCOM - Statistics in the Community. Currently the president of the Iowa State University chapter. Provides outreach to the greater community - statistical consulting to non-profits as well as educational and informative events.
 * President of the Parish Council - 2015-16, Holy Transfiguration Orthodox Christian Church, Ames, IA. 

### Prior work
 
 * Human capital analyst in the HR department of Health Care Service Corporation for 5 years. Providing analytics and data-driven decision making for the Human Resources department in their consultations with internal customers. There were some cool ideas here but it made me realize that I needed a bit more formal grounding in this and decided to get a PhD in statistics as a result.
