I'm Geoff Thompson, a PhD candidate at the Department of Statistics at Iowa State University.
I should be defending this year. My research interests have been in clustering
and other classification problems as well as unsupervised or semisupervised learning.
But, generally, a lot of aspects of going from large messy real-world data 
to the truth of what is going on. Some call it data science but I call it statistics.
The applications have mostly been image-related, but I don't care what things 
look like, really. I also enjoyed working with the statistical consulting group 
for a couple years, since other people's problems are more interesting than my own, 
as that means I would work on the part that's interesting to me and 
they would work on the part that's interesting to them, then they would get to do the 
hard work of finishing the project and writing. For a moment, you feel like an expert 
in a completely foreign field. 

I also like long walks on the beach.

### Awards

 * 2014 Statistical Computing Section Student Paper Award
 * 2015 Departmental Award for Excellence in Statistical Computing
 * 2017 Departmental Award for Excellence in Statistical Consulting
 
### Projects
 
 * `matrixdist` an R package for working with matrix variate distributions such as the matrix variate normal or matrix variate *t*-distribution. On [github](https://www.github.com/gzt/matrixdist).
 * `CholWishart` an R package for some distributions and functions related to the Wishart, in particular sampling from the Cholesky factorization of the Wishart and inverse Wishart. On [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CholWishart) and [github](https://www.github.com/gzt/CholWishart).
 * Porting scalable *k*-means++ (or *k*-means||) to OpenMPI (a minor work).
 * In progress: a similarity metric for binomial and multinomial image comparison accounting for structural similarity.
 * In progress: a parallelization of Hartigan and Wong's k-means algorithm for OpenMPI.
 * In progress: a clustering-based image compression algorithm.
 * In progress: multinomial clustering with covariates.
 * In progress: forensic matching of knife fragments.
 * In progress: even more.

### Other activities

 * STATCOM - Statistics in the Community. Currently the president of the Iowa State University chapter. Provides outreach to the greater community - statistical consulting to non-profits as well as educational and informative events.

### Prior work
 
 * Human capital analyst in the HR department of Health Care Service Corporation for 5 years. Providing analytics and data-driven decision making for the Human Resources department in their consultations with internal customers. There were some cool ideas here but it made me realize that I needed a bit more formal grounding in this and decided to get a PhD in statistics as a result.
