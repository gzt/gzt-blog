I recently gave a [talk at TADS](https://tads.research.iastate.edu/theoretical-and-applied-data-science-lunch-n-learn-geoffrey-thompson) about one of my old projects - 
it's not my best idea but I did put a fair bit of work into it.
The audio/video may be available soon. I will update this post 
when they are if you really want it, but the talks are somewhat
informal.
