People wanting to simulate from the inverse Wishart may want their inverses to be the exact inverses of what are generated by `rWishart` or may be wondering about how, exactly, `rInvWishart` is parameterized. You might expect that simulating from `rWishart` with a covariance matrix `Sigma` gives results related to simulating from `rInvWishart` with covariance `Sigma` or you might want it with covariance `Sigma^(-1)`. So which is it?

```{r demonstrate}
library('CholWishart')
A <- 1.0 * toeplitz(5:1)
set.seed(20190109)
B <- rWishart(1, 10, A)[,,1]
set.seed(20190109)
C <- rInvWishart(1,10,solve(A))[,,1]
B %*% C

```
Use `Sigma^(-1)`.
