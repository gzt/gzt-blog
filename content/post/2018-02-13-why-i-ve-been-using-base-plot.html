<p>Nobody cares what I think, of course. The grammar of graphics is The Way, and <code>ggplot2</code> is my preferred method of visualization. I never even really tried to make my own graphs with base plot until some point last fall (so: after 5 years of R) - I mean, I’m at Iowa State, after all. I don’t hang out with our Graphics Group as much as I should but that’s how I think about plotting. There are a few things at work here:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Sometimes it’s hard to do something in <code>ggplot2</code> and it’s nice to have something else in your back pocket - that’s what happened this fall.</li>
<li>If you’re working with somebody, they might not want to use <code>ggplot2</code> so you’d better be able to cope.</li>
<li>It’s good to be able to deliver code without having to worry about installing or loading a library. Sure, you can use something like <code>if(!require('ggplot2')) install.packages('ggplot2')</code> but added flexibility is never a bad thing.</li>
</ol>
